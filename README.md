# ical.NET

**ical.NET** is a free, open source ical import library for UAP. 
Calendars are a big player on end user devices like phone, tablets or PCs. Widley used formats - like [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545](iCal) - are easy to implement, but however everyone does it a little different.  

This variation creates some serious problem, when it comes down to identifying time zone.  
For example these time zone ids can be found for US Central Time (UTC -6:00):  
+ US-Central
+ US/Central
+ US Central
+ US_Central
